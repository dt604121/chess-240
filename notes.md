## Phase 0 
~ Set up based on the video ~
Commit #1 & #2 - ChessBoard.java / ChessPosition.java / ChessPiece.java
1) ChessBoard.java - implement the constructor / data structure for the squares
2) Implement addPiece/getPiece making sure to compensate for the fact that the board is 1-8 but in 
CS it's 0-7 so we need to subtract one from the row and the column.
3) Implement resetBoard by reinitializing the board to clear it and then setting up each of the chess
pieces. Be sure to generate/include the overrides for toString, equals, and hash to make sure that the 
object methods are taking into account row/col.
4) ChessPiece.java - Create the PieceMovesCalculator. Have pieceMoves return an arrayList.
5) ChessPosition.java - Initialize row/col as well as the getters/setters. Be sure to generate/include the overrides for toString, equals, and hash to make sure that the
   object methods are taking into account row/col.
